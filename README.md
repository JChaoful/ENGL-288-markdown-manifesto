# **The Fuck You List (2020 Edition)**

* I've only come out of the house once a month since quarantine started. Fuck this.
* It's selfish to meet up with the people I miss, but I keep seeing people hanging out anyways. Fuck you!
* Family hasn't gotten along since forever, Dad left and Brother ran away a week ago. Fuck you!
* Mom can't stop crying and is using me as bootleg husband emotional support. Fuck that!
* My dumb ass can't get motivated enough to better myself. Fuck me!
* I miss in-person classes and face-to-face interactions, especially for things like English. Fuck this class!
* But no one participates because personal reasons. Fuck that!
* Why is my libido high for no reason? Fuck me!
* Midterm tomorrow, haven't started studying, I'm a shitty student. How I got where I am is beyond my understanding. Fuck me!
* Wanting to spend time to get closer to people but there's never enough time anymore. Fuck it all!
* Having mostly neutral/on-the-fence views leading to villification by both polarized sides. Fuck politics!
* Being priveleged and well-off to have a comfortable life but still being unsatisfied for some reason. Fuck me!
* Thinking that Child Protective Services breaking up families is a band-aid for family issues. Fuck them!
* Mental Health Disorders are uncontrollable, crippling but also self-exaggerated, self-contained, and a "you" problem, not anyone else's. Fuck that!
* Jeez louise I kinda look like shite. Fuck me!
* Expressing emotional support, encouragement and mutually boosting self-esteem among guys is "gay". Fuck that!
* Passive-aggressiveness, duplicity, and rumor-spreading being more common among girls' circles than it should be. Fuck this!
* I miss cuddling with the cat because it was a substitute for human contact. Fuck that!
* Social cues are hard. Fuck it.
* Distracting myself from my own thoughts by studying and drugging myself through consumption. Fuck me!
